Description: Package provides the classification used for the Kaggle competition
    "predicting online news popularity". The package provides flexibility in
    specification of the classification, with defaults arguments those used for
    kaggle submissions. The data must be provided initially in the form of a test
    and training set. If it is desired to do an out of sample cross validation, then
    an argument allows this as long as the popularity values are provided.
